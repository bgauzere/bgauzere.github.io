## Project/Competition

To complete the project, do your best on the Kaggle competition [Graph Machine
Learning in
Yamoussoukro](https://www.kaggle.com/t/0ea1ce3977c54b3eb0d6d1983fa600a7)
The deadline is set to Friday 20th of December. A report (jupyter notebook is
ok) explaining your work and strategy is required to be sent by mail at
benoit.gauzere@insa-rouen.fr with subject [Project GMLY].

**Data** : Data for the competition is available [here](/gml/data.zip)

## MCQ Evaluation
