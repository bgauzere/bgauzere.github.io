# Two new ANR projects for 2023

For this year, two projects have been funded. First, **ANR FAMOUS** will focus on designing fair ML models, including models operating on graphs. This page will be updated with the link to the projects for further details. Note that we will seek for PhD students to work on this topic. Feel free to drop an email if interested. Second, **ANR OOD** is an ANR project dedicating to the App team of LITIS. In this project, we will focus on anomaly detection. More to come soon.

# A paper at ACPR 2023

With [Linlin Jia](https://jajupmochi.github.io/index_en.html), we have a paper accepted to ACPR 2023 : "Bridging Distinct Spaces in Graph-based Machine Learning". Link to paper and code soon.
