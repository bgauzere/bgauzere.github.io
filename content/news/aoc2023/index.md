# Advent of code 2023

For the second year, I spent too much time in December to solve the problems of
the **advent of code** : https://adventofcode.com/. Finally, I was quite happy to
get the 50 stars. I really like this challenge because it's very well designed
from an algorithmic point of view. Each problem is divided into two
levels. Generally the first one can be solved by using a brute force and naive
strategy, while the second part generally requires to find some tricks to
accelerate the computation and find the right solution. 

I encourage any person able to make a loop and a conditionnal structure in any
langage to have a look. You can play any of the 9 years, and difficulty is
increasing along the years.

I published my own (dirty) solutions on github
[here](https://github.com/bgauzere/adventofcode).

Enjoy !
