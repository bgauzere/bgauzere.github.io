A new school year has just begun at [INSA Rouen
Normandie](https://www.insa-rouen.fr/), providing an opportunity to introduce the various courses in which I am involved:

* [Ananum.](https://moodle.insa-rouen.fr/course/view.php?id=159) In this course, we teach numerical methods for solving linear problems using LU, PALU, Cholesky, and other matrix decomposition techniques. We also delve into SVD problems and iterative methods.
* [Introduction to Machine
Learning.](https://moodle.insa-rouen.fr/course/view.php?id=92) Before delving into deep learning and its extensive ecosystem, we revisit the fundamentals and explore alternative methods. It's essential to keep an eye on various aspects! In this lesson, we cover topics such as clustering, evaluation protocols, optimization, SVM, Bayesian methods, and more.
* [Operationnal
    Research.](https://moodle.insa-rouen.fr/course/view.php?id=1206) Apart from machine learning, many problem-solving
approaches rely on pure algorithms. In this course, we delve into resolution
methods based on graphs, including the renowned Fulkerson algorithm, graph
theory, and graph isomorphism problems. We also discuss how to model problems
effectively.

We look forward to reconvening in January for the second-semester courses !
