# The Competition

Late january 2024, I accompanied students of INSA Rouen to a competition of
competitive programming : the SWERC 2024 in Paris (https://swerc.eu/2023/). This
contest is an international contest between teams of universities from  6  south western
Europe countries, part of the more global ICPC. The contest consists in solving 13 problems of different
difficulties using raw Python, C++ or other languages in 5 hours. Each problem
is a statement with some rules, and must be solved under some constraints which
forbids a naive and straightforward implementation. 

All problems are available on the website, along with hints for the solution.

While first problem is trivial, other ones can be much more difficult, beyond my
skills. I thought problem K  is very interesting from an algorithmic point of
view, and can be a good support to teach advanced algorithmics.

To go further, have a look to the competitive programming book : https://cpbook.net/
