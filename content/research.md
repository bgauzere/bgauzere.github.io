# Research Activities

My current research lies at the interface of graph based representation of data and
the definition of machine learning methods operating on graphs. In my recent works, I
focused on :
* learning edit costs for graph edit distance 
* improve pooling layer for GNN : pooling
* define methods to alleviate the problem of preimage of graphs
* apply graph based machine learning methods to chemoinformatics

## Projects

* [CodeGNN](https://www.normastic.fr/projet-anr-codegnn/) ANR project focused on new
  contributions to Graph Neural Networks both on convolutions and pooling
  operators. Defining new GNN for temporal graphs is also an objective of this project.

## Students

I co-advised some PhD : 

 * Stevan Stanovic (2021-2024) : Apprentissage de la décimation de Graphes pour les GNN

This thesis aims to improve the pooling operator in graph neural networks.

 * Clément Gledel (2020-2023) : Preimage Problem for Graph Data
 
 How can we use modern graph generation techniques to improve the computation of graph
 preimage. 

  * [Linlin Jia](https://jajupmochi.github.io/index_en.html) (2017-2021) :  Machine learning and pattern recognition in chemoinformatics.

Definition of methods based on graph representations for chemoinformatics. Lead to a
contribution on the learning of graph edit distance costs and a preimage method based on
graph median.

* [Guillaume Renton](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=2Cv9_-UAAAAJ&hl=fr) (2017-2021) : Réseaux de Neurones sur Graphes : Analyse et Contributions
  
  This thesis bring some contributions to the analysis of spectral and spatial views of
  GNN's convolutions. It also define a method to include edge information within the
  message passing framework.
