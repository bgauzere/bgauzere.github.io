# Teaching activities
Most of my teaching activities are done at [INSA Rouen
Normandie](https://www.insa-rouen.fr/), within the computer engineering
([ITI](https://www.insa-rouen.fr/formation/specialites-ingenieurses/informatique-et-technologie-de-linformation))
department.

Here a list with ressources to some of my principal courses.

* [Analyse Num√©rique](https://moodle.insa-rouen.fr/course/view.php?id=159)

Matrix factorization (LU,QR,Cholesky), linear systems, eigensystems, iterative methods and more.

* [Algorithmique](https://moodle.insa-rouen.fr/course/view.php?id=60) (resp. Nicolas Delestre)

C programming, collections, dynamic data structure, advanced algortihms.

* [Statistics](https://moodle.insa-rouen.fr/course/view.php?id=169)

regression and statistical signifiance tests.

* [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://moodle.unistra.fr/course/view.php?id=999)

A course given at [UFAZ](https://www.ufaz.az/), a Franco-Azerbaijani university. It
focuses on basics of machine learning including unsupervised (KMeans, PCA) and supervised
(Ridge Regression, SVM) methods. It also includes evaluation protocol and
theory. All ressources can be freely download [here](https://nuage.insa-rouen.fr/index.php/s/g65DXRrNQjyB2zy)
